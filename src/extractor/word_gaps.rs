//! Word gaps written as character spacing, and letter gaps written as `TJ`
//! offsets.
//!
//! Some producers carry a word space as character spacing instead of a
//! space glyph: the two glyphs on either side of the boundary are shown as
//! one short string with a `Tc` as wide as a word space (`3 Tc (dt) Tj` for
//! the "d t" of "send to"), and the spacing is taken back where the glyphs
//! must kern together — with a positive `TJ` offset after the string, or by
//! positioning the next run that far before the pen. The string reads "dt",
//! and the line merges into "sendtoMars".
//!
//! Tracked display text is shown with the same wide spacing and must keep
//! its letters together; the geometry inside the string cannot tell the two
//! apart. The producer's next move can: tracking is never taken back. So a
//! string of two or three glyphs (a boundary, plus a one-letter word between
//! two boundaries) whose junction spacing is a word gap by the `TJ` offset
//! threshold is a candidate, and its junctions become spaces only once the
//! spacing after its last glyph is seen to be taken back.
//!
//! Tracked display text is also set as a `TJ` array with one glyph per
//! string and the letter spacing as the offset between them
//! (`[(V) -250 (A) -250 (L) -250 (L) -250 (E) -250 (Y)] TJ`). Judged one
//! offset at a time against the word-gap threshold, every letter becomes a
//! word. The run's own offsets tell letter gaps from word gaps: see
//! [`tj_tracking`].
