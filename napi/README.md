# PDF Inspector

Fast PDF classification and region-based text extraction for Node.js/Bun. Native Rust performance via [napi-rs](https://napi.rs).

Built by [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) for hybrid OCR pipelines — extract text from PDF structure where possible, fall back to OCR only when needed.

## Features

- **Smart classification** — text-based / scanned / image-based / mixed in ~10–50ms, with a confidence score and per-page OCR routing.
- **Region-based extraction** — pull text from bounding boxes with per-region quality checks (`needsOcr`).
- **Layout-aware** — multi-column reading order, position and font info per text item, RTL support.
- **Robust text decoding** — CID/Type0 fonts via ToUnicode CMaps, plus automatic flagging of broken encodings so callers can fall back to OCR.
- **Selective OCR** — `Auto` routes only pages rejected by native extraction and returns source/model provenance plus hosted-fallback recommendations.
- **External artifacts** — the native package embeds no OCR models, PDFium, or ONNX Runtime; clean `Auto` requests never load or download them.

## Benchmark

[opendataloader-bench](https://github.com/opendataloader-project/opendataloader-bench) corpus (200 PDFs), local engines without model-based PDF parsing; OCR disabled. Scores 0–1, higher is better:

| Engine | Overall | Reading order | Tables (TEDS) | Headings | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **pdf-inspector** | **0.875** | **0.915** | **0.814** | 0.788 | **0.470s** |
| liteparse | 0.873 | 0.913 | 0.693 | **0.811** | 0.750s |
| opendataloader | 0.831 | 0.902 | 0.489 | 0.739 | 2.569s |

| markitdown | 0.589 | 0.844 | 0.273 | 0.000 | 16.165s |

Refreshed July 31, 2026, on Apple M4 Pro; speed is the median of five complete corpus runs after an excluded warm-up. Full methodology and versions are in the [repo README](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector#benchmark), with raw timings and artifacts in the [results branch](https://github.com/firecrawl/opendataloader-bench/tree/abi/pdf-parser-benchmark-results).

## Install

```bash
npm install @firecrawl/pdf-inspector
# or
bun add @firecrawl/pdf-inspector
```

Prebuilt binaries for **Linux x64/ARM64** (glibc and musl/Alpine), **macOS ARM64**, and **Windows x64** — npm installs only the one matching your platform. No Rust toolchain needed.

OCR calls that route work require compatible PDFium and ONNX Runtime shared
libraries. Set `PDFIUM_LIB_PATH` and `ORT_DYLIB_PATH` when they are not on the
platform library search path. The pinned OCR model set is downloaded and
checksum-verified on the first routed page; use `offline: true` with a warm
cache or `modelDirectory` to prohibit network access. See the
[OCR runtime setup guide](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/blob/main/docs/ocr-runtime.md)
for pinned downloads, supported platforms, and hosted-fallback behavior.

## API

### `processPdfWithOcr(buffer: Buffer, options?: OcrOptions): Promise<OcrPdfResult>`

Run native extraction first and OCR only the pages selected by its quality
signals. The default mode is `Auto`; `Off` returns the same detailed result
shape without external runtime work, and `Force` OCRs every selected page.
The work runs on the libuv thread pool and never blocks Node's event loop.

```typescript
import { OcrMode, processPdfWithOcr } from '@firecrawl/pdf-inspector'

const result = await processPdfWithOcr(pdf, {
  mode: OcrMode.Auto,
  pageNumbers: [1, 3], // 1-indexed
})

for (const page of result.pages) {
  console.log(page.pageNumber, page.provenance.source)
}
console.log(result.pagesRoutedToOcr)
console.log(result.pagesRecommendingHosted)
```

For offline deployments, pass `modelDirectory` and `offline: true`. Other
controls include `dpi`, `minimumConfidence`,
`hostedRecommendationConfidence`, and `password`.

### `classifyPdf(buffer: Buffer): PdfClassification`

Classify a PDF as TextBased, Scanned, Mixed, or ImageBased (~10-50ms). Returns which pages need OCR.

```typescript
import { classifyPdf } from '@firecrawl/pdf-inspector'
import { readFileSync } from 'fs'

const pdf = readFileSync('document.pdf')
const result = classifyPdf(pdf)

console.log(result.pdfType)        // "TextBased" | "Scanned" | "Mixed" | "ImageBased"
console.log(result.pageCount)      // 42
console.log(result.pagesNeedingOcr) // [5, 12, 15] (0-indexed)
console.log(result.confidence)     // 0.875
```

### `extractTextWithPositions(buffer: Buffer, pages?: number[], options?: FrameOptions): TextItem[]`

Every text item (plus image placeholders, links and form fields) with its font
and position. `x`/`y` are PDF points relative to the page's **visible page
box** (`CropBox ∩ MediaBox`, else the MediaBox), origin at the box's lower-left
corner with `y` growing upward. `extractTextInRegions` reads its regions
relative to the same box but from its top-left corner with `y` growing
downward, so flip with the box height: `boxHeight - y`. For text items `y` is
the baseline and `height` the font size, so
`[x, boxHeight - y - height, x + width, boxHeight - y]` covers the glyph band
above the baseline (descenders fall below it); for image, link and form-field
items `y` is the rect bottom and that box is exact. Pages whose CropBox equals
the MediaBox at `(0, 0)` are unaffected.

By default the page `/Rotate` is not applied and a page whose text is
predominantly rotated is turned so that text reads left-to-right (this is the
`"sheet"` frame; `extractTextWithPositionsAndRotations` reports which pages
were turned). Pass `{ frame: "display" }` to get every item in the rendered
page's frame instead — the visible page box turned clockwise by the page's
inheritable `/Rotate`, lower-left origin, `y` up, with the turn of a rotated
page undone — so `x`/`y`/`width`/`height` and `rotation` describe the item as
a renderer draws it. Pages with `/Rotate 0` whose text is not predominantly
rotated are identical in both frames.

`fontWeight` is the font's weight class on the 100..900 scale shared by CSS
`font-weight` and the OS/2 `usWeightClass` field (400 regular, 700 bold), read
from the embedded font program's OS/2 table, else the FontDescriptor's
`/FontWeight`, else a weight word in the font name ("Light", "Medium", "-Md",
"Black", "W6"); it is omitted when none of them says. `isBold` is unchanged
and independent of it, so a medium face reports `fontWeight: 500` with
`isBold: false`. Pass `{ boldFromWeight: true }` to also read `isBold` from a
weight class of 600 (SemiBold) or more — or of `boldWeightThreshold`, any
class on the 100..900 scale — and to merge adjacent runs by that verdict, so a
heavier run inside a lighter paragraph keeps its own item while runs whose
weights differ but agree on bold merge as usual.

`boldSource` says where `isBold` came from — `"FontName"` (a bold word or
style abbreviation in the font name), `"FontFlags"` (the FontDescriptor's
ForceBold flag or the embedded program's bold selection), `"WeightClass"`
(the weight class, with `boldFromWeight`) or `"Painted"` (text filled and
stroked to look heavier), the first of them in that order when more than one
says bold — so a face whose name says Bold over a `fontWeight` of 400 can be
told from one whose weight class says so. It is omitted when `isBold` is
`false`.

`fixedPitch` is `true` when the FontDescriptor's FixedPitch flag or the
embedded program's `post` table says the font is monospaced, else measured
from the font's width table: `true` when a dozen or more of its glyphs share
one advance, `false` when two differ. It is omitted when the font declares
nothing and no two advances differ but fewer than a dozen share one. Many
producers write `/Flags 4`
whatever the face, so the flag is only ever read as a yes.

`fillColor` and `strokeColor` are the colours a run was shown with, as sRGB
`[red, green, blue]` arrays of 0..255: its glyphs are filled with the first in
render modes 0, 2, 4 and 6 and outlined with the second in modes 1, 2, 5 and
6. DeviceRGB is read as sRGB, DeviceGray as three equal components and
DeviceCMYK converted the way the PDF specification converts it to DeviceRGB;
ICCBased spaces are read by their component count and Indexed spaces through
their palette. A colour is omitted for any other colour space (Separation,
DeviceN, Pattern, CalRGB, Lab, ...). `renderMode` is the text render mode
(`Tr`) the run was shown with, 0..7: runs in mode 3 (invisible, the mode of OCR
text layers) and mode 7 (clipping only) put no glyphs on the page, so a caller
can tell visible text from invisible text. The colours and the mode are
graphics state — they hold across text objects, `q`/`Q` save and restore them,
and a Form XObject starts with the paint it was invoked under — and reporting
them changes nothing about which runs are extracted. All three are omitted for
image, link and form-field items, and a merged item keeps its first run's.

`legacySymbolRewrite: true` marks items whose decoded text includes a character
changed by legacy symbol cleanup. Merged items retain this evidence from either
source, and split items conservatively inherit it. The field is omitted when
that cleanup did not change a character; absence is not a general guarantee of
decoding accuracy. Consumers correcting other text can use the marker to avoid
treating a rewritten symbol as an authoritative Unicode value.

```typescript
import { extractTextWithPositions } from '@firecrawl/pdf-inspector'

for (const item of extractTextWithPositions(pdf, [1])) { // pages are 1-indexed
  console.log(item.page, item.text, item.x, item.y, item.fontSize)
}

// Boxes as a renderer draws the page (`/Rotate` applied)
const rendered = extractTextWithPositions(pdf, undefined, { frame: 'display' })

// Bold also from the weight class, SemiBold (600) and heavier
const weighted = extractTextWithPositions(pdf, undefined, { boldFromWeight: true })

// ... or from Bold (700) and heavier
const heavier = extractTextWithPositions(pdf, undefined, { boldFromWeight: true, boldWeightThreshold: 700 })
```

### `extractTextWithPositionsAndRotations(buffer: Buffer, pages?: number[], options?: FrameOptions): PositionedText`

`extractTextWithPositions` plus `pageRotations`, one `{ page, rotation: 'ccw' | 'cw' }`
entry per page whose text was predominantly rotated and therefore turned in the
`"sheet"` frame. With `{ frame: "display" }` the items are in the rendered
page's frame and the entries only report which pages were turned.

### `extractTextInRegions(buffer: Buffer, pageRegions: PageRegions[], options?: FrameOptions): PageRegionTexts[]`

Extract text within bounding-box regions from a PDF. Designed for hybrid OCR pipelines where a layout model detects regions in rendered page images, and this function extracts text from the PDF structure for text-based pages — skipping GPU OCR.

Region bboxes are `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` in PDF points with a top-left origin,
relative to the visible page box. By default they are read in the `"sheet"`
frame: the box as laid out in the content stream, `/Rotate` not applied, the
frame `extractTextWithPositions` reports items in flipped to a top-left
origin. The sheet frame matches a rendered page image only when both hold:
the page has `/Rotate 0`, and its text is not predominantly rotated. A page
whose text is predominantly rotated is turned in the sheet frame so that text
reads left-to-right (`extractTextWithPositionsAndRotations` reports which
pages were turned), so its sheet-frame bboxes do not match the rendered image
even with `/Rotate 0`. Pass `{ frame: "display" }` to give bboxes on the
rendered page (the visible box turned clockwise by the page's inheritable
`/Rotate`; the page-level turn of a predominantly rotated page is undone
first, while individual runs keep their own `rotation`), as a layout model
working on page images reports them, whatever the page's `/Rotate` or text
direction. `extractTablesInRegions` takes the same options, `boldFromWeight`
included (see `extractTextWithPositions`).

Each region result includes a `needsOcr` flag that signals unreliable extraction (empty text, GID-encoded fonts, garbage text, encoding issues). When the cause is a suspected garbled text layer, `ocrReason` is set to `"suspected_garbled_text"`.

```typescript
import { extractTextInRegions } from '@firecrawl/pdf-inspector'

const result = extractTextInRegions(pdf, [
  {
    page: 0, // 0-indexed
    regions: [
      [0, 0, 300, 400],    // [x1, y1, x2, y2] in PDF points, top-left origin of the visible page box (CropBox)
      [300, 0, 612, 400],
    ]
  }
])

// The same call with bboxes taken from a rendered page image
const onRendered = extractTextInRegions(
  pdf,
  [{ page: 0, regions: [[0, 0, 300, 400]] }],
  { frame: 'display' },
)

for (const region of result[0].regions) {
  if (region.needsOcr) {
    // Unreliable text — send this region to OCR instead
  } else {
    console.log(region.text) // Extracted text in reading order
  }
}
```

### Async variants

`processPdf`, `classifyPdf`, and `extractPagesMarkdown` are synchronous and parse on the calling thread — in Node, that's the event loop. For a one-off call in a script that's fine, but in a server a large document can hold the loop for tens to hundreds of milliseconds.

`processPdfAsync`, `classifyPdfAsync`, and `extractPagesMarkdownAsync` take the same arguments and produce the same results, but run the parse on the libuv thread pool and return a promise, keeping the event loop free. The input buffer is copied before the call returns, so it's safe to reuse or mutate immediately:

```typescript
import { classifyPdfAsync, extractPagesMarkdownAsync } from '@firecrawl/pdf-inspector'

const classification = await classifyPdfAsync(pdf)
if (classification.pdfType === 'TextBased') {
  const { pages } = await extractPagesMarkdownAsync(pdf)
  // ...
}
```
