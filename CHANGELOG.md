# Changelog

Notable changes to pdf-inspector. Every distribution (Rust crate, Python
package, Node package and platform packages, WebAssembly package) shares one
version. A separate release pull request bumps the manifests with
`scripts/version.py` and renames the `Unreleased` section below to that
version and date. Earlier releases are described in their
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/releases).

## [1.24.0] - 2026-09-22

Changes since 1.23.0.

### Added

- `TextItem::fill_color`, `TextItem::stroke_color` and
  `TextItem::render_mode`: the paint each run was shown with, so a caller can
  read the colour of a run and tell visible text from invisible text. The
  colours are the graphics state's non-stroking and stroking colours as 8-bit
  sRGB `[red, green, blue]`: DeviceRGB read as sRGB, DeviceGray as three
  equal components, DeviceCMYK converted the way the PDF specification
  converts it to DeviceRGB (each channel `1 - min(1, ink + black)`), an
  ICCBased space read as the device space of its component count (1, 3 or 4)
  without applying the profile, and an Indexed space (`/Indexed`, or its
  abbreviation `/I`) through its palette's base space, which another colour
  space resource may name; components outside their range are clamped, and
  `cs`/`CS` start a space at the initial colour the specification gives it
  (black, but white for a four-component ICCBased space, whose components
  all start at 0). A colour is `None`
  for Separation, DeviceN, Pattern and the CIE-based spaces, after a colour
  operator whose operands do not fit its space, and for image, link,
  form-field and OCR items. `render_mode` is the `Tr` mode, `0..=7` — 3
  (invisible, the mode of OCR text layers) and 7 (clipping only) put no
  glyphs on the page — and a `Tr` whose operand is not an integer in that
  range is ignored. The paint is graphics state: it holds across text
  objects, `q`/`Q` save and restore it, a Form XObject starts with the paint
  it was invoked under, and an ActualText span reports the paint of its first
  painted glyph (see below for its weight). Reporting it leaves extraction as
  it was: no run is dropped
  or kept on its account, markdown is unchanged, and an item merged from
  several runs keeps its first run's values. Node `fillColor` and
  `strokeColor` (`[number, number, number]`) and `renderMode`, Python
  `fill_color` and `stroke_color` (`tuple[int, int, int]`) and `render_mode`,
  and the `pdf2md --items-json` fields `fill_color`, `stroke_color` (`[r,g,b]`
  or `null`) and `render_mode` report the same values.
  ([#579](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/579))
- The document information dictionary's `/Author`, `/Subject`, `/Keywords`,
  `/Creator`, `/Producer`, `/CreationDate` and `/ModDate`, beside its
  `/Title`: `PdfProcessResult` and `PdfTypeResult` fields `author`,
  `subject`, `keywords`, `creator`, `producer`, `creation_date` and
  `mod_date`, the dates as written (`D:20240115103000+01'00'`), each `None`
  when the entry is missing or not a string. Node and WebAssembly `author`,
  `subject`, `keywords`, `creator`, `producer`, `creationDate` and `modDate`,
  Python attributes named like the Rust fields, and the members `title`
  through `mod_date` (`null` when absent) of the JSON `pdf2md --json` prints
  in every mode and `detect-pdf --json` prints with and without `--analyze`
  report the same values. Every entry, the title included, is decoded as a
  PDF text string: UTF-16BE after its byte order mark, UTF-8 after its mark
  (PDF 2.0) and PDFDocEncoding otherwise, with UTF-16LE after `FF FE` and
  valid UTF-8 written without a mark read as such, and language escapes and
  trailing NULs dropped. XMP metadata is not read.
  ([#579](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/579))

### Changed

- Rust `TextItem` literals must include the new `fill_color`,
  `stroke_color` and `render_mode` fields (`None` for items that don't come
  from a content-stream show operator), and `PdfProcessResult` and
  `PdfTypeResult` literals the new document information fields.
  ([#579](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/579))

### Fixed

- Text a page's content stream shows with the `"` operator (`aw ac string
  "`: set the word spacing to `aw` and the character spacing to `ac`, move to
  the next line and show `string`) inside a text object is extracted, as it
  already was inside Form XObjects; outside a text object the operator is
  ignored, as `Tj` and `TJ` are there. The page parser skipped the operator
  altogether, so the string was missing from the output and the spacing and
  the line move it makes were lost for the text shown after it.
  ([#579](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/579))
- An ActualText span is bold on its paint's account (text filled and
  stroked to look heavier) when its first painted glyph was painted that
  way, the paint its colours and render mode are reported from. The paint in
  force at the span's end decided, so a render mode, line width or colour
  set after the span's glyphs and before its end made the replacement text
  bold, or plain, whatever painted the glyphs.
  ([#579](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/579))
- The document's `/Title` is decoded as a PDF text string, like the entries
  added above. A title in PDFDocEncoding read with U+FFFD in place of its
  accented letters and of the encoding's typographic punctuation, euro sign
  and ligatures whenever its bytes were not valid UTF-8, and one in UTF-16LE
  after `FF FE` read as mojibake; a title given by reference to a string
  object, or in an information dictionary written in place of a reference,
  was not read at all. Titles in UTF-16BE or valid UTF-8 read as before,
  without a UTF-8 byte order mark, language escapes or the NULs some
  producers pad a string's end with.
  ([#579](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/579))
- Two lines of small type whose baselines lay less than 5 pt apart — a
  stacked table header at 4.7 pt on a 4.5 pt pitch — fell into one line,
  and shown glyph by glyph, as kerned small type is, their glyphs
  interleaved along the baseline into words zipped from both lines.
  A fragment now joins a line when it lies within that 5 pt window of the
  line's first fragment, as before, and within 0.6 em of the larger of its
  own type size and that of a fragment already on the line — no farther
  than the smaller of the two — so two fragments of 8⅓ pt and
  above group exactly as they did, a raised or lowered mark, displaced by
  less than its own em, stays with its line, type of any size pulls a
  fragment of smaller type no farther than that fragment's em, and the two
  lines above stay apart. A fragment without a type size, and an image,
  keeps the 5 pt window.
  ([#580](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/580))

## [1.23.0] - 2026-09-21

Changes since 1.22.1.

### Added

- `PdfProcessResult::cmap_gaps`: the fonts whose ToUnicode CMap (or, for a
  font without one, the embedded program's cmap table) had no entry for
  some of the codes the document shows through it, each a
  `FontCMapGaps` with the font's `/BaseFont` name (or its resource name
  when it has none) and the counts of `codes` shown, `interpolated` (read
  from the mapped codes around them, see below) and `unmapped` (left as
  U+FFFD). The list is always empty in `ProcessMode::DetectOnly`
  (`detect_pdf`, `detectPdf`, `detect-pdf` without `--analyze`), which
  decodes no text, and otherwise empty when every such code had an entry.
  Node `cmapGaps` (`FontCmapGaps[]`), Python `cmap_gaps`
  (`list[FontCMapGaps]`), the WebAssembly result's `cmapGaps` and the
  `pdf2md --json` and `detect-pdf --analyze --json` field `cmap_gaps` report
  the same list.
  ([#568](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/568))

### Fixed

- A Form XObject whose `/BBox` holds numerals too large for any parser —
  a re-save that wraps a page's content in a form writes the box as
  ±(DBL_MAX / 2) in full, 308-digit integers meaning "unbounded" — no
  longer drops out of the document: such numerals are saturated, in the
  file's bytes and in place, to the extent a zero-area box is widened to,
  before the document is read, so the page's text is extracted and the OCR
  pipeline renders it. The page came out empty and was routed to OCR, and
  its render was blank. A box the form refers to (`/BBox n 0 R`) that sits
  in an object stream is repaired in the stream's decoded bytes and read
  back into the document. The Rust-only `widen_degenerate_form_bboxes_mem`
  (the Python, Node and WebAssembly bindings do not expose it) hands the
  repaired bytes to callers that render elsewhere, as for a zero-area box.
  ([#560](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/560))
- Right-to-left text whose runs are shown in reading order — right to left
  across the line, one text object per run — while each run's glyphs are
  stored in visual order with forward advances now reads forwards; every
  word of such a page came out backwards. The page's storage vote counts
  each visible run of two or more right-to-left letters painted forwards as
  visual storage, since a run meant to be read can only display correctly
  when stored that way, so the order of the runs across the line no longer
  reads as logical storage on its own. A text layer that stores its words in
  logical order keeps that reading when it is invisible (text render mode
  3), the convention of OCR layers; the same words shown visibly would
  display backwards, and such a page now reads as visual storage like any
  other visible page.
  ([#561](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/561))
- A simple font whose glyphs were re-encoded — a re-distilled file gives
  the glyphs of its Type1C subsets new codes from 33 upwards, named in
  `/Differences` (`uni0628.i`, `uni064A.m`, `five.tnum`) — but which kept
  the original font's ToUnicode CMap reads those codes by their names. The
  old CMap won wherever a new code landed on a slot it maps, so a letter at
  a bracket slot read as the bracket (mirrored, as a CMap written for a
  right-to-left line describes it), a five at the apostrophe slot as `’`, a
  letter the old CMap never mapped at all as its ASCII slot, and a mark
  glyph whose name spells no character (`arHamzaAboveCCMP`) as a stray `i`.
  The existing repair of such fonts now takes a mirrored bracket or the
  StandardEncoding character of a slot as the slot's own entry; accepts as
  proof that the CMap is stale, besides the three corroborated letters it
  required, a CMap most of whose codes lie outside the font's
  `FirstChar`..`LastChar` range whose entries the names contradict at the
  named slots it does describe — at every one of them when it shares few
  slots with the font, at a majority and three at least when it shares
  many; and once the CMap is proven stale repairs every such slot whose
  name reads as a letter outside ASCII, a no-break space, a ligature, or
  an ASCII letter or digit other than the slot's — or as nothing, for a
  name that spells no character. A font whose CMap agrees with its
  Differences is untouched.
  ([#562](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/562))
- A code that reads as several characters of a right-to-left script — a
  ligature glyph named `uni06440627` (lam-alef), or mapped to two code
  points by the ToUnicode CMap — came out with those characters reversed on
  a page whose text is stored in visual order: the read-back into logical
  order turned every character round on its own. The characters one glyph
  reads as are now turned round together and keep the order they were
  named in.
  ([#562](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/562))
- A spacing accent shown as a text object of its own over a letter — the
  way some producers set an accented letter: the run up to the letter, one
  glyph of `macron`, `acute`, `caron` or another accent the standard Latin
  encodings carry with an advance of its own, placed by its own text matrix
  over the letter, and the run from the letter on — is composed with that
  letter (`o` and a macron read `ō`) and dropped as a fragment. Its origin
  lies a fraction of a point right of the run it decorates, so the line's
  fragments sorted along the baseline put it after that whole run: the text
  read with a stray accent a word on and the letter bare. The accent is
  matched only against the fragments shown just before and just after it,
  over the last glyph of the one or the first glyph of the other, when both
  are level, measured runs without right-to-left letters, neither carries
  an ActualText replacement, their baselines lie within 0.3 em and the
  accent's centre falls within that glyph's advance (estimated from the
  run's width, whitespace counted at 0.28 em — at the run's uniform advance
  for a fixed-pitch face — and the glyph at no less than 0.6 em, with a
  quarter of the accent's own width of play beyond the run's edge for an
  accent overhanging a narrow letter), and only when Unicode has one
  character for the pair (a dotless
  i or j under the accent composes as the dotted letter). A circumflex or
  grave standing beside its neighbours rather than over them, as in code or
  mathematics, is left as shown.
  ([#563](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/563))
- A dependent sign — a vowel sign, a subscript letter, an accent — that its
  font gives no advance and that the producer places over the glyph before
  it with a backward `TJ` offset, returning the pen with a forward one
  before the next glyph, no longer reads as a word gap: a forward offset
  counts only for its travel beyond the farthest the pen has been in the
  array, and only while the pen has shown nothing but zero-advance glyphs
  since it fell behind that mark. A tracked run keeps its tracking across
  such a sign. Such a sign shown as a run of its own (`Tm` and `Tj` per
  glyph) no longer opens a word gap either: the fragment after it is
  measured from where the glyph under it left the pen, and a sign whose
  origin lies within that glyph's advance stays after it when the line's
  fragments are sorted, where a base kerned in ahead of the pen displaced
  it. A word set in such a script came out with a space before most of its
  signs, and now and then with a sign shuffled past its neighbour. Arrays
  without zero-advance glyphs, and producers that position right-to-left
  text with real backtracks past painted letters, read as before.
  ([#564](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/564))
- A scanned page whose producer added a text layer nobody sees — an image
  drawn over at least half of the page, then hundreds of text-showing
  operators under text render mode 3 (invisible) or 7 (clip only) — was
  classified as a text page, because the operator count never consulted
  the render mode; its raster went unread and the layer, which need not
  say what the page shows, was served as the page. Classification now
  follows `Tr` and `cm` through `q`/`Q`, and through the Form XObjects
  the content invokes with `Do` (at each invocation, clipped to the
  form's `/BBox`), and flags a page whose every executed text-showing
  operator leaves nothing to see, while the images it draws — tallied on
  a grid over the page, so a scan tiled into strips counts — cover at
  least half of it (each draw clipped to the page and to the rectangular
  clipping path in force, a clip of any other shape by its box; an inline
  image the content draws counts as an image — for whether the page has
  any at all as well — and so does a path filled or stroked with a tiling
  pattern whose cell draws one; images bound but never drawn, and
  forms never invoked, do not count; a page whose forms outrun the scan's
  budget of invocations or of bytes executed, or whose graphics state
  nests deeper than the scan follows, is not flagged), for OCR
  with the new reason `invisible_text_layer`
  (`OCR_REASON_INVISIBLE_TEXT_LAYER`): the reason appears in
  `pages_needing_ocr`/`ocr_reasons_by_page` and in the per-page
  `needs_ocr`/`ocr_reason`, for the pages a sample left out as well, and
  first among a page's reasons on both surfaces; the classification
  (`pdf_type`) changes in response. Mode-7 text that an
  image, a shading, a painted path or visible text is later drawn through
  — a title filled with a picture — is visible and not counted, its
  glyphs placed by the text-positioning operators and the font size
  (text placed by neither is shown by any paint within the clip); paint
  that misses the glyphs shows nothing through them, nor does a form that
  paints nothing, or a draw off the page or clipped away. Operators are
  read past
  strings, comments and inline image data, and whether or not whitespace
  follows them, so text saying `3 Tr` sets no render mode and `(a)Tj(b)Tj`
  shows twice; text shown with the `'` and `"` operators counts as text,
  here and in the text-operator tallies, which had always missed it,
  while a show operator with nothing to show does not count in either;
  a name written with `#xx` escapes (`/Im#30 Do`) finds the resource it
  names, NUL separates operands as the other whitespace bytes do, and
  unfiltered inline image data is skipped by the length its header gives,
  so that an `EI` among its bytes ends nothing.
  A page whose layer is painted, a page with a visible
  caption over its image, invisible text with no image under it and an
  image with no text keep their classification and reasons; what is
  extracted is unchanged.
  ([#566](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/566))
- A two-byte code of a CID-keyed font whose ToUnicode CMap has no entry for
  it is read from the mapped codes around it when they spell it out: a CMap
  mapping code 36 to `A` and code 38 to `C` says code 37 is `B`, for a gap
  inside a run of digits, of upper-case or of lower-case letters of one
  script whose code points lie exactly as far apart as the codes and whose
  entries rise with their codes, as the glyph order of most fonts does. Such
  codes came out as nothing, so a word set with one lost its letters while
  the document still read as clean text. A gap next to punctuation, across
  a change of case or of script, at the edge of the mapped codes, beside an
  entry of several characters or in a CMap whose entries do not follow the
  alphabet is not read; such a code is now a U+FFFD in the text instead of
  nothing, as a code of a CID font whose CMap cannot be read at all already
  was, so the loss stays visible and `has_encoding_issues` reports it.
  ([#568](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/568))
- A ToUnicode entry whose destination is a control character — U+0001–U+001F
  other than TAB, LF and CR, or DEL — maps its code to no text, and the code
  counts as unmapped. Some producers write a glyph's own index in place of
  its character (a ligature glyph at index 18 gets `<0012> <0012>`, a space
  glyph at index 1 `<0001> <0001>`); the control character it decoded to
  was stripped later without a trace, so a word set with such a ligature
  lost its letters, words set around such a space ran together, and the
  document read as clean text. The code now reads through what the font
  itself says of it — the embedded program's glyph name (`f_f`, `ff`) or
  cmap entry, its `/Differences` name, the encoding a simple font declares
  by name, or a space for a CIDFont glyph with no outline but an advance —
  and as U+FFFD otherwise, so the loss is marked where it happens and
  `has_encoding_issues` reports it; a single-byte code so mapped is no
  longer guessed from its byte value. Entries that map to TAB, LF or CR, and
  CMaps without such entries, read as before.
  ([#567](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/567))
- `pdf2md` and `detect-pdf` read the PDF path as the first argument that
  is not an option, so flags may come before or after it (`--` ends option
  parsing), and a missing input names the path that could not be opened —
  `detect-pdf --json document.pdf` used to open `--json` as the file. The
  built-in CMaps are compiled into the binary instead of being read from
  the crate checkout at run time, which `cargo install` binaries and
  published wheels do not have; `PDF_INSPECTOR_BCMAPS_DIR` still overrides
  them.
  ([#570](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/570))

## [1.22.1] - 2026-09-20

Changes since 1.22.0.

### Fixed

- Glyph names that spell a ligature by its components (`f_t`, `f_f_i`,
  `T_h`), as a `uni` sequence of several code points (`uni00660069`) or
  with a suffix (`a.sc`, `f_i.liga`) decode to the letters they stand for,
  per the Adobe Glyph List Specification, in a font's `/Differences` and in
  an embedded program's own glyph names; they came out as nothing, so a word
  set with such a ligature lost its letters. A name that still cannot be
  read keeps reading as nothing, and a code named more than once keeps its
  last name, whatever kind of name it is. The width fallback for the
  standard 14 fonts gives such a code the width of the letters it spells.
  ([#558](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/558))

## [1.22.0] - 2026-09-20

Changes since 1.21.0.

### Added

- `TextItem::bold_source`: where `is_bold` came from, so a caller can weigh
  the verdict against `font_weight` — `BoldSource::FontName` (a bold word or
  foundry style abbreviation in the font name), `FontFlags` (the
  FontDescriptor's ForceBold flag or the embedded program's bold selection),
  `WeightClass` (the weight class, with `bold_from_weight`) or `Painted`
  (text filled and stroked to look heavier), the first of them in that order
  when more than one says bold; `None` when `is_bold` is `false`. A face
  whose name says Bold over a weight class of 400 reports `FontName`, a
  600 face that is bold only by the option `WeightClass`. Node `boldSource`
  (`"FontName"`, `"FontFlags"`, `"WeightClass"`, `"Painted"`, omitted when
  there is none), Python `bold_source` (`"font_name"`, `"font_flags"`,
  `"weight_class"`, `"painted"` or `None`) and the `pdf2md --items-json`
  field `bold_source` report the same value.
  ([#547](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/547))
- `TextItem::fixed_pitch`: whether the font is monospaced. `Some(true)` when
  the FontDescriptor's FixedPitch flag or the embedded program's `post`
  table says so; else measured from the font's width table, `Some(true)`
  when a dozen or more of its glyphs share one advance and `Some(false)`
  when two differ; `None` when the font declares nothing and no two
  advances differ but fewer than a dozen share one (ten tabular digits are
  too few), and for image, link and form-field items. Many producers write `/Flags 4` whatever the
  face, so the flag is only ever read as a yes. Node `fixedPitch` (omitted
  when unknown), Python `fixed_pitch` and the items JSON field
  `fixed_pitch` report the same value.
  ([#547](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/547))
- `PositionOptions::bold_weight_threshold`: the weight class from which
  `bold_from_weight` reads bold, on the 100..=900 scale, 600 by default —
  what the option always did. Rust `PositionOptions::bold_weight_threshold(700)`,
  Node `{ boldFromWeight: true, boldWeightThreshold: 700 }` and Python
  `bold_weight_threshold=700` on the same functions that take
  `bold_from_weight`. Read only when the option is on; Node and Python
  reject a value outside 100..900, Rust clamps it into the scale.
  ([#547](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/547))
- `tests/fixtures/font_metadata_faces.pdf`, generated by
  `scripts/make_font_metadata_fixtures.py` from renamed subsets of the
  DejaVu fonts (their licence is reproduced in
  `tests/fixtures/FONT_LICENSES.md`): faces whose names, OS/2 weight
  classes, bold selections, descriptor flags and width tables each make one
  point about the metadata above, exercised by the Rust, Node and Python
  tests.
  ([#547](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/547))
- Rust `widen_degenerate_form_bboxes_mem(bytes)`: the document re-serialized
  with the zero-area `/BBox` of its Form XObjects widened, or `None` when no
  form needs it and for an encrypted document, for callers that render the
  document with their own renderer. The Python, Node and WebAssembly
  bindings do not expose it.
  ([#550](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/550))

### Fixed

- Right-to-left text stored in visual order now reads back through the
  Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm, line by line. A Hebrew or Arabic word
  came out with its letters mirrored when the line also held a number, a
  Latin phrase or punctuation. A colon, a period or a percent sign next to
  a number landed on the wrong side of it. Embedded Latin phrases and
  numbers keep their own order, mirrored brackets turn back into the
  characters that were written (by the Unicode mirroring data), and a line
  of a Latin paragraph that quotes a right-to-left word keeps reading left
  to right.
  ([#552](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/552))
- Hebrew and Arabic text positioned one glyph per show operator merges into
  words by the line's own gaps instead of taking a word space after every
  glyph whose declared width falls short of its advance, so a word no
  longer comes out as scattered letters.
  ([#552](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/552))
- Arabic (and Hebrew) presentation forms — the positional and ligature
  code points that a font subsetted by glyph maps its glyphs to — are
  normalized to the letters they stand for once the text is in reading
  order, so a ligature's letters come out in order too.
  ([#552](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/552))
- Tracked display text set as a `TJ` array with one glyph per string and
  the letter spacing as the offset between them (`[(V) -250 (A) -250 (L) …]
  TJ`) came out with a space between every letter. The offsets of such a
  run are now judged over the run's own tracking, so letter gaps stay
  inside the word and only a gap wider by a word space ends it. Words
  positioned by offsets and kerned glyph runs read as before, on the page
  and inside Form XObjects; so do one-letter words half a space width apart
  or more, except a run of single capitals or digits set that wide, which
  display tracking produces and which now reads as one word, as the merge
  of separately shown glyphs already had it.
  ([#548](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/548))
- A Form XObject whose `/BBox` has no area — `/BBox [0 0 0 0]` on a form
  holding a page's content, a re-save pattern — is repaired when the
  document is loaded: the box is widened to one that clips nothing, since
  taken as written it hides the form entirely and a page drawn through it
  comes out blank. The OCR pipeline renders the repaired document — a
  decrypted copy, in memory, when the document is encrypted — so such a
  page is no longer a blank render. A box with an area is left as written.
  ([#550](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/550))
- A page of vector drawings whose text is shown through a CID-keyed font
  with a ToUnicode CMap was reported as vector-outlined text (`vector_text`)
  and routed to OCR: the rule counted the distinct letters and digits among
  the bytes of the string operands, and the two-byte codes of such a font
  are glyph indices. On those pages the text is now judged decoded: it is
  the page's text when it shows as many distinct letters and digits as the
  byte count asks of a simple font and the drawing stays under a hundred
  path operators per character, so a paragraph beside a chart or a title
  over an illustration is a text page, while a page of paths with a
  caption's worth of text, a title and address line over outlined body
  text, or a CMap that maps every code alike, still goes to OCR.
  ([#551](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/551))
- A Form XObject whose content inflates past the page-content bound is now
  skipped, as a page over it already was, instead of being decompressed in
  full before the operator cap could apply; a ToUnicode CMap the detector
  reads is bounded the same way as the loader's own streams.
  ([#551](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/551))

- Simple fonts decode through their base encoding where their
  `/Differences` say nothing: an encoding dictionary's `/BaseEncoding` now
  applies whether or not the dictionary also carries `/Differences` (a
  `/WinAnsiEncoding` or `/MacRomanEncoding` base without them decoded as
  StandardEncoding, dropping or mistranslating accented letters), and the
  standard Symbol and ZapfDingbats fonts read through their built-in
  encodings instead of as the Latin letters at the same codes.
  ([#553](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/553))
- Embedded fonts without a ToUnicode CMap decode through their glyph names
  where a symbol cmap only offers private-use code points, so a glyph named
  `uni03B1` or `alpha` reads as α rather than as the byte it was shown
  with; `/Differences` names that are glyph indexes (`g12`, `glyph12`,
  `index12`) resolve through the embedded font program.
  ([#553](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/553))

### Changed

- With `bold_from_weight`, adjacent runs are merged by the bold verdict
  rather than by their weight classes: a run the weight makes bold stays
  apart from its plain neighbours as before, while runs whose weights differ
  but agree on bold — a 300 face beside a 400 one, or a 600 face beside a
  bold-named 400 one — merge as they do without the option. Splitting on any
  weight difference (unknown against 400 included) fragmented glued runs
  and broke line recovery for callers.
  ([#547](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/547))
- `is_bold_font`, and with it the default `is_bold`, recognises every name
  the weight-class parser puts at 600 or heavier: "Demi", "Ultra", "Heavy"
  and "Black" as whole words, the foundry style abbreviations "-Sb", "-Dm",
  "-Hv", "-Blk", "-XBd" and "-Ult", and the weight digits "W6" to "W9". The
  abbreviations are matched as whole tokens after the family name, in the
  mixed case foundries write them, so "Bookman" is still not Book and "LT"
  not Light. Faces such as a Franklin Gothic Demi or a Helvetica Neue Heavy
  are bold by default, in the positioned items and in the Markdown output,
  so every face the weight option calls bold the default flag calls bold
  too; the flag's older reading of a Medium face as bold (weight class 500)
  stays.
  ([#547](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/547))
- Rust `TextItem` literals must include the new `bold_source` and
  `fixed_pitch` fields (`None` when unknown).
  ([#547](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/547))

## [1.21.0] - 2026-09-18

Changes since 1.20.0.

### Added

- `TextItem::font_weight`: the font's weight class on the 100..=900 scale
  (400 regular, 700 bold), read from the embedded font program's OS/2
  `usWeightClass`, else the FontDescriptor's `/FontWeight`, else a weight word
  in the font name, foundry abbreviations included ("Light", "Medium", "-Md",
  "-Lt", "-Blk", "W6"); `None` when none of them says. Node `fontWeight`
  (omitted when unknown), Python `font_weight` and the `pdf2md --items-json`
  field `font_weight` report the same value. `is_bold` is unchanged.
  ([#536](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/536))
- An opt-in `bold_from_weight` on the positioned-text and region APIs, next
  to the frame option: Rust `PositionOptions` with the `_with_options`
  variants (`extract_text_with_positions_mem_with_options`,
  `extract_text_with_positions_and_rotations_mem_with_options`,
  `extract_text_in_regions_mem_with_options`,
  `extract_tables_in_regions_mem_with_options`), Node `{ boldFromWeight: true }`
  in the options of the same four functions, Python `bold_from_weight=True`
  on `extract_text_with_positions`, `extract_text_with_positions_and_rotations`,
  `extract_text_in_regions` and their `_bytes` variants. When on, `is_bold` is
  also `true` for a weight class of 600 or more, and adjacent runs whose
  weight class differs stay separate items instead of merging, so a heavier
  run inside a lighter paragraph keeps its own item. Off by default, where
  `is_bold` and item merging are unchanged.
  ([#536](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/536))

### Fixed

- Text painted wholly outside the rectangular clip in force when it was
  shown is no longer extracted. Such runs are invisible on the rendered page
  — labels a charting library parks off its plot area, content the producer
  cropped away — yet used to come back as ordinary text and leak into the
  words around the figure, on every API. Only a single finite, axis-aligned
  rectangle clip counts (nested `q`/`Q` and intersections of rectangles
  included); text under a path, text-mode or turned clip is kept as before,
  as are runs inside Form XObjects, rotated runs and runs whose advance is
  unknown. A run has to lie a quarter of its height clear of the clip on
  every side, so glyphs straddling an edge stay. Unlike render-mode-3 text,
  the left-out runs are not an invisible layer that transcribes the page:
  `include_invisible` does not bring them back, and a page whose every run
  is clipped away reports no text, like an image-only page.
  ([#539](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/539))
- A file whose `%PDF-` header is preceded by other bytes — an echoed
  multipart envelope, a line of text — is no longer rejected as not a PDF,
  on every API. The header is located within the first 1024 bytes, as
  mupdf, pdfium and poppler do, and the file is read from there so its
  cross-reference offsets stay exact; a canonical `%PDF-M.N` header line
  outranks a version-like mention in the leading bytes. A byte order mark
  or whitespace before the header was already tolerated, and a bare `%PDF`
  without the dash is still not a header.
  ([#538](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/538))

### Changed

- Rust `TextItem` literals must include the new `font_weight` field (`None`
  for items whose weight class is unknown).
  ([#536](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/536))

## [1.20.0] - 2026-09-14

Changes since 1.19.0.

### Added

- An optional display frame for the positioned-text and region APIs. Rust
  `extract_text_with_positions_mem_in_frame`,
  `extract_text_with_positions_and_rotations_mem_in_frame`,
  `extract_text_in_regions_mem_in_frame` and
  `extract_tables_in_regions_mem_in_frame` take a `PositionFrame`; Node
  `extractTextWithPositions`, `extractTextWithPositionsAndRotations`,
  `extractTextInRegions` and `extractTablesInRegions` take an optional
  `{ frame: "sheet" | "display" }`. `"display"` reports items in, and reads
  region rects from, the rendered page — the visible page box turned clockwise
  by the page's inheritable `/Rotate`, with the turn of a predominantly rotated
  page undone — so boxes line up with a rendered page image. `"sheet"`, the
  default, is unchanged. `extractTextWithPositionsAndRotations` also accepts
  the same 1-indexed `pages` filter as `extractTextWithPositions`.
  ([#533](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/533))

### Fixed

- Preserve word spaces painted as separate whitespace runs squeezed by
  negative character spacing, so adjacent words no longer merge.
  ([#517](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/517))
- Read blank, advancing glyphs in symbolic TrueType fonts as word spaces
  while preserving invisible text layers and formatting characters.
  ([#521](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/521))
- Recover text from cmap-less TrueType subsets using standard Macintosh
  glyph ordering when the embedded font's metrics corroborate the mapping.
  ([#522](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/522))
- Decode painted glyphs when `ActualText` contains replacement characters,
  and keep spaced or separately painted dot leaders with their text line.
  ([#523](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/523))
- Start `TJ` sub-runs at their first painted glyph after leading positioning
  offsets, correcting their bounds and the order of split words.
  ([#527](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/527))
- Word spaces carried by character spacing instead of space glyphs — the two
  glyphs around a word boundary shown as one string with a `Tc` as wide as a
  word space, the spacing taken back with a positive `TJ` offset or by
  positioning the next run — no longer glue their words together
  ("sendtoMars"). Such a string reads with its spaces once the spacing after
  it is seen to be taken back; tracked display text, whose spacing never is,
  keeps its letters together.
  ([#530](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/530))
- A contents page whose entries end in right-aligned page numbers without dot
  leaders — an edited volume's table of contents with the chapter authors on
  their own lines — is rendered as a contents list, one entry per line with
  its page number tab-separated, instead of being read as a two-column page
  whose titles and numbers interleave into a paragraph.
  ([#493](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/493))

### Changed

- Upgrade `lopdf` to 0.45.0 for improved recovery of malformed cross-reference
  entries and `startxref` / `/Prev` offsets.
  ([#534](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/534))

## [1.19.0] - 2026-09-09

Changes since 1.18.0.

### Added

- Rust `TextItem::legacy_symbol_rewrite` and optional Node `legacySymbolRewrite`
  identify text changed by legacy symbol cleanup. Merged and split items retain
  this evidence; a false or absent marker does not guarantee decoding accuracy.
  ([#519](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/519))

### Fixed

- Preserve bold emphasis simulated by filling and stroking text, including
  nested forms, and retain inline styling in long quoted prose.
  ([#511](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/511))
- Apply horizontal text scaling (`Tz`) to bounds and advances, including
  reflected text and nested forms, so scaled text lands in the correct region.
  ([#510](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/510))
- Recover narrowly verified stale Unicode mappings in embedded subset fonts
  while preserving valid semantic mappings and ligatures.
  ([#516](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/516))
- Keep independently positioned text runs separate when their measured advances
  lie inside distinct rectangular clipping regions, including visual-order RTL.
  ([#518](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector/pull/518))

### Changed

- Rust `TextItem` literals must include the new `legacy_symbol_rewrite` field
  (`false` for items without legacy symbol cleanup). The Node field is optional
  and emitted only when cleanup changed a character.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-09-07

Changes since 1.17.0.

### Added

- `TextItem::baseline_shift`: signed offset, in points, of a superscript or
  subscript glyph run from the baseline of the body text it is attached to
  (positive = raised, negative = lowered, `0` for normal text). Exposed as
  `baseline_shift` in the Python bindings and `pdf2md --items-json`, and as
  `baselineShift` in the Node bindings, so consumers can emit `<sup>`/`<sub>`
  themselves. `TextItem::line_y()` returns the body baseline a run belongs to
  and `TextItem::is_script()` tells flagged runs apart.
- `TextLine::text()` and `text_with_formatting()` wrap flagged runs in
  `<sup>…</sup>` / `<sub>…</sub>` (`Yibo Yan<sup>1,2,3</sup>`,
  `V<sub>f</sub>`, `10<sup>–15</sup>`), with word spacing decided by the
  measured gap at the run's edges. Table cells render runs the same way
  through one shared cell-text module, and items are assigned to cells by the
  body baseline they belong to, so `V<sub>f</sub>` and `$1,234<sup>1</sup>`
  survive inside tables too.
- `tests/fixtures/cropbox_offset_origin.pdf`, a page whose CropBox origin is
  not `(0, 0)`, with Rust, Node and Python tests pinning the shared coordinate
  frame described under Changed.
- `TextItem::rotation`: the run's baseline angle in degrees counter-clockwise,
  in `[0, 360)` (`0` horizontal, `90` reading bottom-to-top, `270`
  top-to-bottom, `180` upside-down), and `TextItem::advance_known`, which is
  `false` only when the box's extent along the baseline is an estimate
  because the font carries no width metrics. Both are exposed as `rotation` /
  `advance_known` in the Python bindings and `pdf2md --items-json`, and as
  `rotation` / `advanceKnown` in the Node bindings. Consumers that detected
  rotated runs through `width == 0` should key off `rotation` instead.
- `extract_text_with_positions_and_rotations_mem` (Node
  `extractTextWithPositionsAndRotations`, Python
  `extract_text_with_positions_and_rotations[_bytes]`) returns the items
  together with the frame of every page whose text was predominantly rotated
  and therefore turned (`PageRotation::Ccw` / `Cw`, now public).
  `collect_text_in_region_in_frame` takes that frame explicitly, and
  `RegionCoordSpace::Rotated90Cw` completes the region API for clockwise
  pages.

### Fixed

- Object-stream decompression is bounded during loading with lopdf 0.44,
  preventing excessive memory use. Oversized streams are skipped, and
  documents with no readable pages fail cleanly.
- Embedded TrueType fonts recover bold styling from `head.macStyle` when
  OS/2 metadata is unavailable, while explicit OS/2 styling remains
  authoritative. Word spacing and numeric continuity survive bold boundaries.
- PDFs with 19-byte classic cross-reference entries ending in a bare LF or
  CR now load through a repair pass instead of failing with `invalid file
  trailer`.
- Raised and lowered marker glyphs no longer form their own line. Line
  grouping — the Markdown pipeline and `extract_text_in_regions`
  (`extractTextInRegions`) alike — compares baselines through `line_y()`, so
  affiliation markers 4–7pt above an author line, footnote references after
  a sentence, and unit exponents (`kg/m³`) stay on the line they annotate.
  Previously the whole marker run of an author block came out as an orphan
  `,2,3,2,4,*` line above the names.
- Script detection is geometric: a run is a sub/superscript when it is
  0.4–0.75× the size of a tightly adjacent neighbor and sits at a real
  baseline offset from it. Multi-glyph runs (`1` `,` `2` `,` `3`, `2,*`,
  `1)`, `th`, `max`) are recognised as one run; markers that LEAD their word
  (`¹Hong Kong University`, `<sup>3,4</sup>Some Institute`) attach to the
  following word; markers after closing punctuation (`sentence.²`) and after
  digits (`$1,234<sup>1</sup>`) are no longer glued on as body text.
- Digit-only runs beside a word keep fusing as Unicode super/subscript
  characters (`H₂O`, `word²`, `See note¹²`); level small runs (small caps,
  same-baseline size changes) are no longer mistaken for subscripts.

- Text shown with a rotated text matrix (a vertical arXiv-style margin stamp,
  a rotated table header) reported `width == 0` and the font size as
  `height`; downstream code then substituted a character-count width, turning
  the stamp into a phantom horizontal line that `extract_text_in_regions`
  assigned to the body paragraph it crossed. Every run now gets the
  axis-aligned box of its glyph run — a vertical run is tall and thin — from
  one geometry helper shared by the page and Form XObject parsers, and upright
  text keeps its historical box exactly.
- Pages whose text reads top-to-bottom (clockwise) are turned against their
  own direction instead of the fixed counter-clockwise turn that mirrored
  word and line order; link and AcroForm widget boxes, page-box clipping, and
  region matching follow the turned frame. Only runs within about 20° of an
  axis vote on the turn, so a page of diagonal text keeps its frame, and so
  does a page whose vertical runs split evenly between the two directions.
- A run whose font carries no width metrics gets a half-em-per-painted-glyph
  estimate laid along its baseline (character and word spacing included),
  and the text cursor moves by the same estimate, so the runs that follow it
  no longer pile up on one origin.
- A reflected text matrix has no rotation — its reading direction and its
  glyphs' orientation differ by a half turn — so such a run reports how its glyphs
  stand: `0` for the mirrored-x matrix some producers paint right-to-left
  text with, which then merges, groups into lines, and carries
  decorations like the upright run it looks like. A negative `Tf` size turns
  a run around and reads as `180`; upside-down runs group into lines by the
  baseline they hang from (`TextItem::baseline_y()`).
- ActualText runs shown under a scaled text matrix reported widths multiplied
  by the scale twice.
- Form XObjects inherit the invoking stream's text rise and rendering mode
  (text state is graphics state), so `3 Tr` hidden text inside a form stays
  hidden on the visible pass and a form drawn under a raised baseline keeps
  it.
- Upside-down (180°) runs are never merged or split in reverse, their lines
  sort in reading order, and their underlines and strikeouts are recognised
  from their own baseline; RTL lines drawn with mirrored-x matrices keep the
  classic right-to-left order.

### Changed

- **Coordinate frame of positioned output — consumer action may be required.**
  `extract_text_with_positions*` (Rust), `extractTextWithPositions` (Node),
  `extract_text_with_positions[_bytes]` (Python) and `pdf2md --items-json` now
  report `x`/`y` relative to the page's visible page box — `CropBox ∩ MediaBox`,
  else the MediaBox — with the box's lower-left corner as the origin. Image,
  link and form-field items shift the same way. Previously the values were raw
  content-stream coordinates, so on pages whose CropBox (or MediaBox) origin is
  not `(0, 0)` every item was displaced from anything rendered from the CropBox,
  and consumers intersecting items with rendered regions silently selected the
  wrong text.
- The region APIs interpret their inputs relative to the same box:
  `extract_text_in_regions*`, `extract_tables_in_regions*`,
  `detect_vector_grid_in_region*` and the TSR crop bboxes
  (`TsrTableInput.crop_pdf_pt_bbox`) are top-left-origin PDF points relative to
  the visible page box, and `StructuredCell.page_pt_bbox` is returned in it.
  These previously flipped `y` with the MediaBox height and ignored the box
  origin.
- Pages whose CropBox equals the MediaBox and whose MediaBox origin is `(0, 0)`
  — the vast majority — produce identical output. Consumers that compensated
  for the CropBox origin themselves must drop that adjustment. `/Rotate` is
  still not applied.
- Rust: `TextItem` gained the required public field `baseline_shift`, so code
  that builds a `TextItem` with a struct literal must add it (`0.0` for normal
  text). This follows the precedent of `font_tag` in 1.17.0; the Python and
  Node bindings are unaffected.
- Snapshot fixtures `thermo-freon12` and `shannon-entropy-p1-2` updated for
  the corrected script handling (`Freon<sup>®</sup>`, `V<sub>f</sub>`,
  `2<sup>N</sup>`, `¹Nyquist`, `log<sub>b</sub> a`).
- Rust: `TextItem` gained the required public fields `rotation` and
  `advance_known`, so struct literals must add them (`0.0` and `true` for
  ordinary upright text). Items that do not come from a text matrix (images,
  links, form fields, OCR) report `0.0` / `true`.
- Rust: the legacy `collect_text_in_region` still infers only the
  counter-clockwise frame from a page's item coordinates; callers with
  clockwise pages should pass the frame reported by
  `extract_text_with_positions_and_rotations_mem` to
  `collect_text_in_region_in_frame`, or use `extract_text_in_regions_mem`,
  which handles both turns itself.
